# App project 

Hello everyone, my name is Julio Cesar and I'm currently studying computer engineering, as my first project in Python, I created an application that obtains student information such as name, CPF, monthly fee and installments. The entire application was created with the purpose of optimizing tasks for small schools, I also used the tkinter and sqlite3 libraries.
